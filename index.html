    <h1>Hello World!</h1>

    <p> It seems fitting to begin my portfolio in the same way my coding journey began.</p>

    <p>My Data Science Journey</p>

    <p>
        What is a successful portfolio? Most would argue that it should be a collection of completed projects that put you and your work in the best light.
    </p>

    <p>
        While I would generally consider this definition to be true, I don't believe it should just be limited to that.

        Certainly it is a great feeling to see your work and be proud of what you have accomplished, but a part of me feels that you can learn more from those projects that you couldn't get over the finish line.
    </p>
    <p>
        In that regard, what you will find within this repository won't necessarily be only projects I have found success in but also those that did not find the outcome I had started out to find.

        In those less than ideal projects, I will show my journey and if I had to shift gears or change my expectations I will do my best to highlight where I may have gone wrong as well as show where I found a different definition of success.
    </p>




    <p>Come on in, take a seat and let's prepare to embark on this journey together.</p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>This is a work in progress, and certainly a number of things need to be added like maybe a theme to clean it up, but it is for the time being a working page. </p>

    <h1>About me.</h1>

    <p>Name: Christopher Nosky (Chris)</p>
    <p>Location: Lincoln, NE</p>
    <p>Phone: (402) 417-8648</p>

    <p>
        Hobbies: I enjoy building custom pc's and more importantly, custom cooling loops.
        I also enjoy tinkering with and driving cars, I'm not terribly particular on whether it's foriegn or domestic, new or old, I love them all.
        Additionally, I highly enjoy (weather permitting) getting on the motorcycle and pointing the tire in a direction and just riding
    </p>
    <p>Pets: Currently I do have 2 cats and I'm working on setting up an aquarium, though I'm not certain on what types of fish I intend to put in there but there should be a decent variety. </p>

    <p>
        Alright, now for the part you actually care about, as you can see, clearly I'm not a UX designer. With my HTML and CSS skills/knowledge being fairly limited, even setting up this page was a bit of a stretch for me.
        From the start of my working life, I've always been interested in understanding the underlying data as a way to improve a process. I've spent the majority of my time working in manufacturing environments as a technical operator,
        mostly within the pharmaceutical industry, which you can imagine has a fair bit of data behind it's processes whether it is set-up data for the equipment, maintenance data, or data on the manufactured product itself.
    </p>

    <p>
        For me, the only problem with having all of that data at hand was that at the time I truly didn't know how to harness or unlock what that may have been telling us. I couldn't look at the aggregate data over the course of a year,
        I couldn't summarize what was happening, when it was happening,or find any commonalities and trends to find a link to any one specific thing.
    </p>

    <p>
        Enter Data Science, now while I cannot claim to have unlocked the secrets of the universe with all I've learned here, I can say it has introduced me to many tools to understand and identify insights from data. From expolortitory data analysis (EDA)
        to neural networks (NN), I have found many different tools to help me understand and take action with different data sets. Pairing these tools with Python or R, I've learned differing methods for gathering and cleaning data, engineering different features
        and how to put that data in clear and easy to understand visuals to share with stakeholders.
    </p>

    <p>With that, take some time and explore my different projects, I will of course be adding to and continue to introduce new projects as my journey continues, so feel free to check back.</p>
